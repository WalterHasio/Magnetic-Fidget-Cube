Remix of a Kobayashi Fidget Cube, this one prints in separate pieces and uses magnets inside the hinges.  There are two versions, using 5x5mm cylinder magnets* and 4x4mm cylinder magnets*.  This has been sitting in my upload queue for over a year, but I misplaced the print and only rediscovered it the other day.  I have only made the 5mm version, 

Two magnets are inserted in an opposing position to form each hinge.  If the alignment of the magnets are set correctly the fidget cube will hold stable in most positions (the hinge magnets attract one another).  It may actually run smoother as a fidget cube the other way around, with the magnets resisting the rectangular shapes, but I haven't tried it.  A completed fidget cube will need 8 hinges, 32 magnets, and 8 blocks (half of them mirrored).

If you need to disassemble the hinges, it helps to have larger magnets*, they can be used from the outside to force the hinge magnets together so they can be disassembled.
